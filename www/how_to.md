title: "How to use LikertMaker_online"
---

**_LikertMakeR_** synthesises and correlates Likert-scale and related 
rating-scale data. 

You decide the mean and standard deviation, and the correlations 
among vectors, and the package will generate data with those 
properties, usually accurate to two decimal places. 

The following panels show how to:

 a. Generate Likert-scale items from Cronbach's Alpha and predefined moments
 
 b. Generate correlated multi-item scales


In both cases, this is a multi-step process 
  
  1. establish a correlation matrix  
  
  2. establish rating-scale properties
  
  3. generate the data
  
  4. validate the data
