**_LikertMakeR online_** is an online implementation of two functions from the 
**_LikertMakeR_** package for the _**R** statistical programming language_.

**Author**: _Hume Winzar_

**Date**: _June 2025_

#### Motivation

I was prompted to write the functions in _LikertMakeR_ after reviewing too many journal article submissions where authors presented questionnaire results with only means and standard deviations (often only the means), with no apparent understanding of distributions. 

Hopefully, this tool will help researchers, teachers, and other reviewers, to better think about rating-scale distributions, and the effects of variance, boundaries and number of items in a scale.
