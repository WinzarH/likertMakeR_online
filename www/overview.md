### LikertMakeR online

**_LikertMakeR_** synthesises and correlates Likert-scale and related 
rating-scale data. 

You decide the mean and standard deviation, and the correlations 
among vectors, and the package will generate data with those same predefined 
properties. 



#### Generate a dataframe from Cronbach's Alpha and predefined moments

This is a two-step process ... plus validation:
  
  1. generate a correlation matrix from desired alpha and desired dimensions 
  
  2. generate rating-scale items from the correlation matrix and desired item properties
  
  3. validate the resulting dataframe
