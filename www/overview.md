### LikertMakeR online

**_LikertMakeR_** synthesises and correlates Likert-scale and related 
rating-scale data. 

You decide mean and sd, and correlations among vectors, 
and the package will generate data with those same predefined properties. 



#### This is a two-step process ... plus validation:
  
  1. Define a correlation matrix 
     - Specify Cronbach's alpha for a multi-item scale, or
     - Upload your own correlation matrix as a CSV file (suggested for correlating multi-item scales)
  
  2. Define rating scale parameters: sample-size, name, mean, SD, number of 
  items in each scale
     - Input parameters manually, by editing the on-screen table, or
     - Upload a CSV file of parameters. Download a template for editing if needed.
  
  3. Validate the resulting dataframe
     - Visualise correlated scales and see summary statistics
